# Bananajour

Local git repository hosting with a sexy web interface and bonjour advertising. It's like your own little network-aware github.

## Installation

    gem install bananajour

## Getting started

Start it up

    bananajour
    
add a new project

    cd ~/code/myproj
    bananajour add
    git push banana master

and fire up http://localhost:90210/

If somebody starts sharing a bananjour repository with the same name on the network it'll automatically show up on the web interface, along with their branches and recent git commit activity.
