Bananajour - Local git publication and collaboration
====================================================

Local git repository hosting with a sexy web interface and Bonjour discovery. It's like a bunch of adhoc, local, network-aware githubs!

Unlike Gitjour, the repositories you're serving are not your working git repositories, they're served from `~/.bananajour/repositories`. You can push to your bananajour repositories from your working copies just like you do with github.

Bananajour is the baby of [Tim Lucas](http://toolmantim.com/) with much railscamp hackage by [Nathan de Vries](http://github.com/atnan), [Lachlan Hardy](http://github.com/lachlanhardy), [Josh Bassett](http://github.com/nullobject), [Myles Byrne](http://github.com/quackingduck), [Ben Hoskings](http://github.com/benhoskings), [Brett Goulder](http://github.com/brettgo1), [Tony Issakov](https://github.com/tissak), and [Mark Bennett](http://github.com/MarkBennett). The rad logo was by [Carla Hackett](http://carlahackettdesign.com/).

Installation and usage
----------------------

You'll need at least [git version 1.6](http://git-scm.com/). Run `git --version` if you're unsure.

Install it from github via gems:

    gem install toolmantim-bananajour

(you might need to do a `gem sources -a http://gems.github.com` beforehand!)

Start it up:

    bananajour
    
Initialize a new Bananajour repository:

    cd ~/code/myproj
    bananajour init

Publish your codez:

    git push banana master

Fire up [http://localhost:9331/](http://localhost:9331/) to check it out.

If somebody starts sharing a Bananajour repository with the same name on the
network, it'll automatically show up in the network thanks to the wonder that is Bonjour.

Official repository and support
-------------------------------

[http://github.com/toolmantim/bananajour](http://github.com/toolmantim/bananajour) is where Bananajour lives along with all of its support issues.

Developing
----------

If you want to hack on the sinatra app then do so from a local clone but run your actual bananjour from the gem version. Running the sinatra app directly won't broadcast it onto the network and it'll run on a different port:

    ruby sinatra/app.rb -s thin

If you want code reloading use [shotgun](http://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun) instead:

    shotgun sinatra/app.rb -s thin

If you then want to run your working copy as your public bananajour rebuild and install it as a gem:

    sudo rake gem:install

Bananas were meant to be shared. There are no secret bananas.
